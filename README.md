# libcp
libcp: short for library competitive programming. It is library and template starter for c++ and c programmers with an implementation of bits/stdc++.h and more useful functions that I will keep adding on.

And since most competitive programming competitions do not use this library I have included a c++ starter template in [templates](./templates) which you can use that contains bits/stdc++.h and all the other functions in an usable manner.

## Testing

I have tested this c++ version of this library on clang++ and g++.

I have tested the c version of this library on clang and gcc.

for more info look at [test/](./tests/)
